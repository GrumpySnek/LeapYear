# Leap Year Checker

This is a very simple program designed to quickly determine whether an entered year is a Leap Year or not.
I have used [this](https://www.mathsisfun.com/leap-years.html) website as a reference for my calculations. 

To use the calculator, type in a year and click "Check if it's a Leap Year!" button. 
A paragraph will pop up below the button to tell you whether the entered year is a Leap Year or not.
